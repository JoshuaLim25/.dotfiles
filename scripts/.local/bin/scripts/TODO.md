# Script Ideas
- Script `sanitycheck` that lets you just test your sanity about various quirks of a language.
    - Picker for which lang in those supported (bash, go, etc).
    - Def use the right extension name, maybe hardcoded `/tmp/sanitycheck.${lang_ext}`
    - Similar to how `goplay` is now with `/tmp`, just takes "Which lang? Supported: bash, go, rust, etc"

- `mvtodo` to rename to `TODO:$filename` and have a picker to select amongst these
